# My Role Playing Game Challenge

Welcome to my journey of learning Basic JavaScript by building a Role Playing Game using freeCodeCamp's curriculum!
In this exciting practice project, I delved into the world of JavaScript and reinforced my understanding of fundamental programming concepts by crafting a Role Playing Game (RPG). Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and much more.

## What I Learned

- **Arrays:** I explored how to store and manipulate collections of data efficiently.
- **Strings:** I learned techniques for working with text data, such as concatenation and manipulation.
- **Objects:** I understood how to organize and manage related data using objects and their properties.
- **Functions:** I dove into the world of functions, reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
- **Loops:** I mastered the art of repetition by using loops to iterate over arrays and perform actions.
- **Conditional Statements:** I discovered how to control the flow of my code with if/else statements, making decisions based on conditions.

## Repository Contents

- **index.html:** The main HTML file for my Role Playing Game.
- **styles.css:** The CSS file containing styles for the game's interface.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file containing the logic and functionality of my Role Playing Game.
